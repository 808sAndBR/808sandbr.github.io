## Why I built this
“I don’t care I just want to play with the app!”  <a href='https://808sandbr.shinyapps.io/National_parks_roadtrip/'> Fair enough, here you go!</a>

For the Data Products class we were asked to build any shiny app. Having gone to Yosemite a while ago, I have been day dreaming of taking a road trip to see more of the National Parks. So I decided that I wanted my app to let users put in the location where they will start their trip and how many parks they want to visit then it will tell them what parks should be on their road trip, plan the order for them, and give some information about the parks on their trip.
