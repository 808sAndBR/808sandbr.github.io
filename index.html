          <strong>I'm Scott, I like to ask data questions... and then write some code to find answers when it doesn't respond.</strong>
          <br><br>
          I've always found problem solving and figuring out how things work exciting. Having recently discoved how much data and code alow me to explore, I've been pouring my free time into learning more. Check out my <a class = "about_text" href="/curriculum">data science curriculum</a> to see what I've been studying or take a look at <a class = "about_text" href="/portfolio">my portfolio</a> to see some of the projects I have been working on.
          <br><br>
          I'm also into rock climbing, hip hop, exploring San Francisco, terrible puns, and traveling with minimal planning.
