          <p>After graduating from Miami University with a degree in Finance and working in Dayton, Oh for a year I moved out to Palo Alto, Ca to work for <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a> where I have played roles in Marketing, Operations, User Support, and anything /everything else we have ended up needing. Once I moved out here I started playing with code, so I'm creating this site to have somewhere for various projects to live.</p>
